 RieszEnergyOptimization 

# Description 
Minimizing the Riesz energy using some standard solvers. The code tries to find
a (local) minimum of an energy functional generated by a discrete subset of the
$ d $-dimensional unit sphere assuming the points of this subset interact via
Riesz potential. 

The problem is controlled by a set of parameters specified in the _control.inp_
file:
- **s** is the power used in Riesz kernel
- **dim** dimension of the ambient space
- **file** is an int, controlling whether a starting configuration is provided; if
  not, a random one is generated
- **numpts** total number of points in the configuration
- **outfile** name of the output file; .txt extension will be appended
- **LBFGSHistorySize** previous iterations of the LBFGS-method that need to be taken into account

The uppercase prefix shows the solver that's being used. Suffixes: _parallel
uses OMP, _truncated minimizes an energy produced by the truncated version of
the Riesz kernel.
